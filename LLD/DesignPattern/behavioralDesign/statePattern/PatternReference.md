# statePattern — Interview Reference

## Intent
Provide a concise intent for the statePattern pattern.

## Problem Statement
## What is it? The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class when the state changes.

## Why Simple Code Fails
Often ad-hoc solutions (if/else, scattered constructors, tight coupling) make code hard to extend and test.

## Solution Overview
Describe how the statePattern pattern solves the problem by providing structure and separation of concerns.

## Minimal Java Example
## Without Pattern

```java
// Example not provided.
```

## With Pattern

```java
// Example not provided.
```


```java
// Example not provided in original README.
```

## Advantages
- Describe key advantages (decoupling, extensibility, reuse).

## Disadvantages
- Describe trade-offs (complexity, indirection, overuse).

## When NOT to Use
- Situations where the pattern is unnecessary.

## Common Mistakes
- Frequent anti-patterns or pitfalls.

## Framework / Library Usage
- Notes on common frameworks or language features.

## System Design Use Cases
- Real-world systems where this pattern helps.

## Interview One-Liner
One-line summary of the pattern.
